The FitnessGramâ„¢ Pacer Test is a multi-stage aerobic capacity test that 
progressively gets more difficult as it continues. 
The 20-meter Pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. 
The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster every 
minute after you hear this signal: *music* A single lap should be 
completed every time you hear this sound: *music* The second 
time you fail to complete a lap, your test is over. The test will begin 
on the word "start". Ready? Set? Start.
